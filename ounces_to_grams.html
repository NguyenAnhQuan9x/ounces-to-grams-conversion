            How to convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/ounces-to-grams">ounces to grams</a> is shown in the worked example problem below. This is a typical problem with
            converting mass units.
            Let's start with a food example since recipes are one of the most frequent practical uses for this
            conversion:

            Maybe you have a problem: 1 bag of butter weighs 16 ounces. What is its weight in grams?
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the easiest ways to solve this problem is to use the pound to kilogram conversion. If you like in a
            country where both units are used,
            this is a useful conversion to know. Start by converting ounces into pounds.
            Then convert the pounds into kilograms. All that remains is to move the decimal point three places to the
            right to convert kilograms into grams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the conversions you need to know:<br>
            <span id="formula">
                16 oz = 1 lb<br>
                1 kg = 2.2 lbs<br>
                1000 g = 1 kg<br>
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            You are calculating "x" grams of weight. Convert ounces to pounds first. In the following step of the
            solution, pounds are converted to kilograms,
            and in the last step, kilograms are converted to grams. Keep in mind that units cancel each other out,
            leaving you with just grams.
        </p>
        <p>
                x g = 16 oz<br>
                x g = 16 oz x (1 lb/16 oz) x (1 kg/2.2 lb) x (1000 g/1 kg)<br>
                x g = 463.12 g<br>
        </p>
